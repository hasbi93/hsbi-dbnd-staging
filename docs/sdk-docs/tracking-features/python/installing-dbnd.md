# Installing DBND

From the command line, run the following command:
```shell
pip install databand
```

The DBND PyPI basic package installs only packages required for getting started. Behind the scenes, DBND does conditional imports of operators that require extra dependencies.

Whether you are looking to track your pipeline metadata, or if you want to orchestrate pipelines, you may want to install DBND plugins for integrating with third-party tools.

| See [Connecting DBND to Databand](doc:access-token) to learn how to connect SDK integrations into your Databand Application.


## Installing Plugins

Run the following command to install any of the plugins listed in the tables below. For example:
```shell
pip install dbnd dbnd-airflow
```

You can use bundled installation via `databand[plugin-slug]`
```shell
pip install databand[airflow]
```

## Plugins for tracking

### SDK version in different parts of the system.
It's strongly advised that you use the same SDK version across all components in communication - for example, an Airflow DAG Python environment and a Spark cluster environment.


# System Requirements
You can install DBND on the following operating systems:
  * Linux (*Recommended for production*)
  * macOS
  * Windows

## Software requirements
