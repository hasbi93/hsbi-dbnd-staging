Every organization is different. We built DBND to be extensible so that different teams can customise the platform according to their preferences and style of work. This section covers the most common ways to extend DBND:

* [Custom Target](doc:custom-target) 
* [Custom Value Type](doc:custom-value-type) 
* [Custom Parameter](doc:custom-parameter) 
* [Custom Decorators](doc:custom-decorators) 
* [Custom Marshaller](doc:custom-marshaller)
