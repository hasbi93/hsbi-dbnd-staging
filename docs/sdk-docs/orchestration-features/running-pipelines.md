DBND provides a command-line interface that enables you to run pipelines and tasks, and configure the installation.

The basic syntax is `dbnd <command name>` followed by positional arguments and then one or more named arguments.

```bash
$dbnd run --help
```

## Run Command

The `run` command is used to run DBND tasks and pipelines from the command line. Run specific and global configuration parameters can also be set from the command line.

```python
from dbnd import task

@task
def prepare_data(data: str) -> str:
    return data
```

```bash
$dbnd run prepare_data
```

See [Task Discovery](doc:task-discovery)  for the proper way of referencing tasks in the command line.


## Running tasks in parallel
It is possible to run tasks in a pipeline in parallel with the help of `local_parallel` executor. You can use `--parallel`, e.g. `dbnd run <task_name> --parallel`.  Keep it in mind that `--parallel` is only supported with Apache Airflow installed. If you still get errors when trying to run tasks in parallel, make sure that Airflow is specified in the cfg file. Make sure to use a non-SQLite database for your Airflow or you won't be able to run tasks in parallel.


Example:
```bash
dbnd run calculate_alpha --task-version now --parallel
```


> Use `--open-web-tab`  to open the result of a run in a new tab in the Databand UI.
